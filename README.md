# Individual_Project
A repository for all the different code files that were produced for my individual project. The code includes several jupyter notebooks that use an LSTM based VAE approach to molecule generation in SMILES format. One purely for results and one for educational purposes.

The "Original_Code" notebook refers to the original file I used to build, train my model on, as well as generate all the figures for the report. The "Assignment_1" files refer to the educational notebooks that were constructed using the principles of the model that was constructed. They are written to be used for a computerclass for Machine Learning in Chemistry and can be adjusted and used as you the reader see fit. You dont need to ask any consent.

The "models" and "data" directory were too big to add into this Github and are therefore added in the canvas hand-in. In case someone external is reading this, the code can still be used. You would just need to supply your own data and train your own model, but the code has everything to accommodate that. :)
